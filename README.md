# README

This is a nodejs Twitter bot. It tweets whimsical transit delay announcements twice each peak. Uses `random-js` and a bunch of JSON files. Designed for Melbourne, but with a bit of imagination you could easily rework it for your own city.

See it in action at [@PT_delays](https://twitter.com/PT_delays).
